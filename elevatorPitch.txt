First of all, Weibo is a popular Social Network Site in China that is similar to Twitter. A dataset that includes the following relation among 800 accounts on Weibo was found on UCI Machine Learning Repository. The relation can be modeled as a huge directed graph. Adding some interactive features can also show clique in the graph, which can be a group of friends in the relation network. Moreover, Weibo, like Twitter also has a problem about spam and Bot accounts. Visualization of the relation network can let us find out more characteristics of these accounts, so it can be helpful for spam detection too.
